## üíª Code Examples

The `code/` directory contains Python examples to help you understand and practice the concepts covered in the course:

- **Learning-focused examples** that demonstrate key concepts
- **Runnable code** to help solidify your understanding of the theory
- **Educational implementations** covering topics from each course section
- **Mock APIs and fallbacks** when external services aren't available

### Running the Examples
```bash
# Install dependencies (optional - code includes fallbacks)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Try out examples from any section
cd code/module1/section1_introduction
python3 basic_examples.py
```

**Note**: These examples are designed for learning and experimentation. For production use, you'll want to adapt and extend them based on your specific requirements.

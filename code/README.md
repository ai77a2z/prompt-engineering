## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Python dependencies (optional - code works without them)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables (optional for API examples)
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Running Examples

Each section can be run independently:

```bash
# Section 1: Introduction and API Integration
cd module1/section1_introduction
python3 basic_examples.py
python3 api_integration.py

# Section 2: Core Prompting Techniques
cd module1/section2_core_techniques
python3 prompting_techniques.py

# Section 3: Professional Workflow
cd module1/section3_professional_workflow
python3 evaluation_frameworks.py
python3 workflow_management.py

# Section 4: Production Best Practices
cd module1/section4_best_practices
python3 production_frameworks.py
```

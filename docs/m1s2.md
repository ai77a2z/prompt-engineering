# 2\. Core Prompting Techniques

The following techniques are fundamental building blocks for effective prompt engineering. These techniques form the foundation of advanced prompt engineering and can be combined to create sophisticated AI interactions.

### 2.1 Zero-Shot Prompting

You ask the model to perform a task without giving it any prior examples of how to do it. This works for simple, well-understood tasks but can be enhanced with advanced techniques.

#### Basic Zero-Shot Example
```python
prompt = """
Extract all email addresses from the following text and return them as a JSON list.

Text: "You can reach out to support@example.com or for sales, contact sales-team@example.com. Do not use admin@example.com."
"""
```

#### Advanced Zero-Shot with Reasoning Framework
```python
advanced_zero_shot = """
# ROLE & EXPERTISE
You are an expert data extraction specialist with knowledge of email validation patterns.

# COGNITIVE APPROACH
1. Scan text for email patterns (username@domain.extension)
2. Validate each potential email against RFC standards
3. Categorize by purpose (support, sales, admin, etc.)
4. Assess confidence level for each extraction

# TASK
Extract all email addresses from the following text.

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
Return a JSON object with:
- "emails": array of valid email addresses
- "categories": purpose classification for each email
- "confidence_scores": reliability rating (0.0-1.0) for each extraction
- "validation_notes": any concerns about email validity

# ERROR HANDLING
If no valid emails found, return: {"emails": [], "message": "No valid email addresses detected"}

Text: "You can reach out to support@example.com or for sales, contact sales-team@example.com. Do not use admin@example.com."
"""
```

#### Zero-Shot Performance Optimization
```python
# Technique: Constraint-based zero-shot
optimized_zero_shot = """
Extract email addresses with the following constraints:
- Must follow standard email format (user@domain.tld)
- Exclude any emails marked as "do not use"
- Include confidence assessment
- Process in order of appearance

Return format: [{"email": "address", "confidence": 0.95, "context": "purpose"}]

Text: [INPUT_TEXT]
"""
```

### 2.2 Few-Shot Prompting

You provide the model with a few examples (`shots`) of the task being completed. This helps the model understand the pattern, format, and desired output quality.

#### Basic Few-Shot Example
```python
ticket_to_classify = "The login button is not working on the mobile app."

prompt = f"""
Classify the support ticket as 'Bug', 'Feature Request', or 'Question'.

Ticket: 'How do I change my password?'
Category: Question

Ticket: 'It would be great if you added a dark mode.'
Category: Feature Request

Ticket: '{ticket_to_classify}'
Category:
"""
# Expected Output: Bug
```

#### Advanced Few-Shot with Reasoning
```python
advanced_few_shot = f"""
# CLASSIFICATION TASK
Classify support tickets with reasoning and confidence scores.

# EXAMPLES WITH REASONING
Ticket: "How do I change my password?"
Reasoning: User is asking for instructions on an existing feature
Category: Question
Confidence: 0.95

Ticket: "It would be great if you added a dark mode."
Reasoning: User is suggesting a new feature that doesn't currently exist
Category: Feature Request
Confidence: 0.90

Ticket: "The app crashes when I try to upload a photo."
Reasoning: User reports unexpected behavior indicating a software defect
Category: Bug
Confidence: 0.98

# CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA
- Bug: Unexpected behavior, errors, crashes, or malfunctions
- Feature Request: Suggestions for new functionality or improvements
- Question: Requests for help, information, or clarification

# YOUR TASK
Ticket: "{ticket_to_classify}"
Reasoning:
Category:
Confidence:
"""
```

#### Dynamic Few-Shot Selection
```python
class DynamicFewShotSelector:
    def __init__(self, example_bank):
        self.example_bank = example_bank
    
    def select_examples(self, input_text, num_examples=3):
        # Use semantic similarity to select most relevant examples
        similarities = []
        for example in self.example_bank:
            similarity = self._calculate_similarity(input_text, example['input'])
            similarities.append((similarity, example))
        
        # Return top N most similar examples
        similarities.sort(reverse=True)
        return [example for _, example in similarities[:num_examples]]
    
    def generate_prompt(self, input_text, task_description):
        selected_examples = self.select_examples(input_text)
        
        prompt = f"{task_description}\n\n"
        for example in selected_examples:
            prompt += f"Input: {example['input']}\nOutput: {example['output']}\n\n"
        prompt += f"Input: {input_text}\nOutput:"
        
        return prompt
```

#### Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought
```python
few_shot_cot = """
Solve these math word problems step by step.

Problem: "Sarah has 15 apples. She gives 3 to her friend and buys 8 more. How many apples does she have?"
Thinking: Sarah starts with 15 apples. After giving away 3, she has 15-3=12 apples. Then she buys 8 more, so 12+8=20 apples.
Answer: 20

Problem: "A store sells books for $12 each. If someone buys 4 books and pays with a $50 bill, how much change do they get?"
Thinking: 4 books cost 4Ã—$12=$48. Change from $50 is $50-$48=$2.
Answer: $2

Problem: "Tom runs 3 miles every day for a week. How many miles does he run in total?"
Thinking:
Answer:
"""
```

### 2.3 Persona Pattern

You instruct the model to adopt a specific role or persona. This focuses the model's knowledge and tone, leading to more context-aware and expert-level responses.

#### Basic Persona Example
```python
message = "John Smith, our customer at 122 Main St, called to complain. His email is john.s@email.com."

prompt = f"""
You are a GDPR compliance officer. Review the following message for Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
Identify all PII categories found in the text.

Message: "{message}"
"""
```

#### Advanced Multi-Layered Persona
```python
advanced_persona = f"""
# PERSONA DEFINITION

```

#### Dynamic Persona Adaptation
```python
class PersonaManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.personas = {
            "technical_expert": {
                "identity": "Senior Software Architect with 15+ years experience",
                "expertise": ["system design", "scalability", "performance optimization"],
                "communication_style": "technical precision with practical examples"
            },
            "business_analyst": {

        Provide analysis from your expert perspective.
        """
```

### 2.4 Advanced Output Formatting

You explicitly instruct the model to structure its response in a specific format, like JSON or XML. This is critical for integrating LLM outputs into automated workflows and software.

#### Basic Structured Output
```python
invoice_text = "Invoice #456: 1x T-Shirt for $25.00, 2x Mug for $15.50 each."

prompt = f"""
Extract all line items from the following invoice text.
Return the result as a JSON array where each object has "item", "quantity", and "price" keys.

Invoice: "{invoice_text}"
"""
```

#### Advanced Schema-Driven Formatting
```python
schema_driven_prompt = f"""
# OUTPUT SCHEMA DEFINITION
Return data conforming to this exact JSON schema:
{{
  "invoice_data": {{
    "invoice_id": "string",
    "line_items": [

        "item_name": "string",
        "quantity": "integer",
        "unit_price": "float",
        "total_price": "float",
        "category": "string (clothing|accessories|other)"
      }}
    ],
    "subtotal": "float",
    "metadata": {{
      "extraction_confidence": "float (0.0-1.0)",
      "parsing_notes": "string"
    }}
  }}
}}

# VALIDATION RULES
- All prices must be positive numbers
- Quantities must be positive integers
- Total price = quantity Ã— unit_price
- Subtotal = sum of all total_prices

# ERROR HANDLING
If data cannot be extracted, return:
{{
  "error": "extraction_failed",
  "reason": "specific reason for failure"
}}

Invoice text: "{invoice_text}"

## 2.7 Advanced Parameter Control: Mastering Model Behavior

When you make an API call, you can pass multiple parameters that influence the model's output style, creativity, and reliability. Understanding these parameters is crucial for fine-tuning model behavior for specific use cases.

### Core Sampling Parameters

#### **`temperature`** - The Creativity Dial
This parameter controls the randomness of the model's output. It accepts a value between 0 and 2.

**Technical Details:**
- Controls the softmax temperature in the probability distribution
- Lower values make the distribution more peaked (deterministic)
- Higher values flatten the distribution (more random)

**Practical Guidelines:**
```python
# Ultra-precise tasks (financial calculations, code generation)
temperature = 0.0  # Completely deterministic

# Factual tasks (data extraction, summarization)
temperature = 0.1  # Minimal randomness

# Balanced tasks (customer service, explanations)
temperature = 0.3  # Slight variation

# Creative tasks (marketing copy, brainstorming)
temperature = 0.7  # Moderate creativity

# Highly creative tasks (storytelling, poetry)
temperature = 1.0  # High creativity

# Experimental/artistic tasks
temperature = 1.5  # Very high randomness
```

#### **`top_p`** (Nucleus Sampling) - Quality Control
Controls the cumulative probability cutoff for token selection. Value between 0 and 1.

**How it works:**
- Selects from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds `top_p`
- More sophisticated than `top_k` as it adapts to the probability distribution

**Practical Applications:**
```python
# High-quality, focused outputs
top_p = 0.1  # Very conservative, only most likely tokens

# Balanced quality and diversity
top_p = 0.9  # Standard setting for most applications

# More diverse outputs
top_p = 0.95  # Allows more token variety

# Maximum diversity (use with caution)
top_p = 1.0  # No filtering
```

**Advanced Usage Pattern:**
```python
# Combine with temperature for fine control
config_precise = {"temperature": 0.2, "top_p": 0.8}  # Focused but not rigid
config_creative = {"temperature": 0.8, "top_p": 0.95}  # Creative but coherent
config_experimental = {"temperature": 1.2, "top_p": 0.9}  # High creativity with quality control
```

#### **`top_k`** - Vocabulary Limiting
Limits the model to consider only the top K most likely tokens at each step.

**Use Cases:**
```python
# Highly constrained vocabulary (technical documentation)
top_k = 10

# Moderate constraint (business writing)
top_k = 40

# Balanced approach (general content)
top_k = 50

# More variety (creative writing)
top_k = 100
```

### Advanced Control Parameters

#### **`frequency_penalty`** - Repetition Control
Reduces the likelihood of repeating tokens based on their frequency in the text so far.

**Range:** -2.0 to 2.0
- **Positive values:** Discourage repetition
- **Negative values:** Encourage repetition
- **Zero:** No penalty

**Strategic Applications:**
```python
# Avoid repetitive content (reports, articles)
frequency_penalty = 0.5

# Strong anti-repetition (creative writing)
frequency_penalty = 1.0

# Encourage consistency (technical documentation)
frequency_penalty = -0.2

# Maximum repetition avoidance
frequency_penalty = 2.0
```

#### **`presence_penalty`** - Topic Diversity
Reduces the likelihood of repeating any token that has appeared in the text so far.

**Key Difference from Frequency Penalty:**
- Frequency penalty: Based on how often a token appears
- Presence penalty: Based on whether a token has appeared at all

**Applications:**
```python
# Encourage topic diversity (brainstorming)
presence_penalty = 0.6

# Strong topic variation (creative exploration)
presence_penalty = 1.2

# Maintain topic focus
presence_penalty = 0.0
```

### Advanced Parameter Combinations

#### **Task-Specific Configurations**

    def __init__(self):
        self.profiles = {

### Dynamic Parameter Adjustment

#### **Context-Aware Parameter Selection**
```python
class DynamicParameterController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.adjustment_rules = {
            "input_length": {
                "short": {"temperature": +0.1},  # Slightly more creative for short inputs
                "long": {"temperature": -0.1}   # More focused for long inputs
            },
            "complexity": {
                "simple": {"top_k": -10},        # Reduce vocabulary for simple tasks
                "complex": {"top_p": +0.05}     # Increase diversity for complex tasks
            },
            "domain": {
                "technical": {"frequency_penalty": -0.1},  # Allow technical repetition
                "creative": {"presence_penalty": +0.2}    # Encourage topic diversity
            }
        }

        adjusted = base_params.copy()
        
        for factor, conditions in self.adjustment_rules.items():
            if factor in context:
                condition = context[factor]
                if condition in conditions:

                            adjusted[param] = max(0, min(2, adjusted[param] + delta))
        
        return adjusted
```

### Parameter Optimization Strategies

#### **A/B Testing Framework**
```python
class ParameterOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.test_configurations = []
        self.results = []

    def find_optimal_parameters(self, task_type, test_cases, optimization_target):
        """Find the best parameter combination for a specific task"""
        # Define search space based on task type
        if task_type == "factual":

### Production Best Practices

#### **Parameter Monitoring and Adjustment**
```python
class ProductionParameterManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_history = []
        self.adjustment_thresholds = {
            "accuracy_drop": 0.05,
            "creativity_insufficient": 0.3,
            "repetition_excessive": 0.4
        }
    
    def monitor_and_adjust(self, current_params, performance_metrics):
        adjustments = {}
        
        # Check for accuracy issues
        if performance_metrics.get("accuracy", 1.0) < 0.8:
            adjustments["temperature"] = max(0.0, current_params.get("temperature", 0.3) - 0.1)
            adjustments["top_p"] = max(0.1, current_params.get("top_p", 0.9) - 0.1)
        
        # Check for repetition issues
        if performance_metrics.get("repetition_score", 0.0) > 0.3:
            adjustments["frequency_penalty"] = min(2.0, current_params.get("frequency_penalty", 0.0) + 0.2)
        
        # Check for creativity issues
        if performance_metrics.get("diversity_score", 1.0) < 0.5:
            adjustments["temperature"] = min(2.0, current_params.get("temperature", 0.3) + 0.1)
            adjustments["presence_penalty"] = min(2.0, current_params.get("presence_penalty", 0.0) + 0.1)
        
        return adjustments if adjustments else None
```

### Key Takeaways for Parameter Control

1. **Start with Task-Appropriate Defaults**: Use established parameter profiles for your specific use case

2. **Test Systematically**: Don't guess - use A/B testing to find optimal parameters

3. **Monitor Performance**: Track how parameter changes affect output quality

4. **Combine Parameters Thoughtfully**: Parameters interact with each other - test combinations

5. **Adjust Gradually**: Make small parameter changes and measure impact

6. **Context Matters**: Consider adjusting parameters based on input characteristics

7. **Document Your Findings**: Keep records of what parameter combinations work for different scenarios

Remember: Parameter tuning is both an art and a science. The optimal settings depend on your specific use case, data, and quality requirements. Always validate parameter changes with real-world testing before deploying to production.
